# project-inspector-gadget

This project is brought to you by the fabulous Team Klatch!

This project is focused on assisting the city of Chicago in prioritizing city buildings to inspect.

What we have accomplished so far:
* Produced basic descriptive statistics for a subset of the building data using python.
* Explored adding features, such as examining temporal trends in violations by building
* Worked on predicting violations by building.

Go Team Klatch!
